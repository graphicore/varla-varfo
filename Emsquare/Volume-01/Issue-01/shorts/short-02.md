title: "The colossal value in tiny changes"
---

In our article on “Space… “, it was written and demonstrated that changes to linespacing or tracking are useful to some purposes for improving typography, and that those values change evenly across all glyphs, while they don’t effect the appearance of all glyphs equally. So, TT and OO respond differently to tracking because their shapes are different, as do ”o” and “p” in responding to changes in line spacing.

And of course, one of the keys to not exposing these differences is to use line and letter spacing judiciously, i.e. when needed, and as little as possible. In practice, this is in contrast to the use of so-called registered axes, where large changes from size to size, weight to weight, or width to width are often required, to make distinct expressions of changes in content as it relates to other content’s typographic choices. This is not to leave out the obvious changes brought by italic, color or many other treatments and effects.*

Course versus fine typographic adjustments are not much different from everyday practice elsewhere; the main ingredient of a dish for 12 people usually lands in the kitchen with a thud, the pepper with a sprinkle. We go faster to cover long distances, but slow down to find places, and Archaeological digs start with the a shovel, end with a spoon. While those efforts require significantly more energy to accomplish the large changes, typography today requires the same amount of effort to change the size by 1 or 100, perhaps to the detriment of typographic finesse.

Beginning with this issue we are showing some of the finesse being applied to justification among other things. In our next issue will detail the working of those small values, and introduce some other tiny changes.
