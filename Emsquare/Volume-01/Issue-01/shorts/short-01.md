title: "Tracking tracking issues in kerning (that hides)"

In common practice, the type designer visually assigns default spaces and adds kerning pairs to the glyphs of a font to reduce the likelihood the word space could be confused with the space between two letters, or two letters overlapping ungracefully.

Both of these composition issues, letters being to far apart or too close, and dramatic, expansive word spaces, can be introduced by the use of tracking, or tracking with standard justification. The simplest example is when a pair of glyphs has needed more separation, a positive kern like "f?". This pair is added, but then, in essence deleted by the tracking.
