An important but often overlooked property of the CSS-unit system is that,
on screens, its absolute length units don't describe what their names
imply they do. The reasons are historical, and the current status quo allows authors
to design without thinking about the deeper nature of their target devices,
like size and viewer distance—which is a good thing. However, the
consequences are that a CSS-Pixel is likely not a hardware pixel on the
display, and that a CSS-Inch is likely not a real-world physical Inch.
Regarding the latter, two categories of [use cases](#use-cases) are made infeasible or
hard to implement:

 * measuring or proofing
 * accurate design, especially for [fixed media](#excursion-the-tale-of-fixed-media)

This article is about enabling CSS-authors to work with real-world physical
measurements, and to make it easier to do so.

## "A robust and minimal calibration scheme"

This is a demo of a simple widget that lets you, the user, calibrate your
screen so that it can confidently display real-world distance units.
Calibration is a big word; I hope the widget demonstrates sufficiently
that it is *quickly done* and *not a big deal*.

<div class="insert_calibration_widget"></div>

If the widget was used correctly, we can now use real-world sizes:

One real centimeter: <span class="sample-physical" style="--sample-size: 1cm"></span>
One real inch: <span class="sample-physical" style="--sample-size: 1in"></span>

The result is set to a custom property in CSS on `:root` as `--unit-scale-physical` its value
is <code class="insert insert-unit-scale-physical"></code>.

The example expects square pixels. Generally, it is possible to calibrate
width and height separately. However, on the web, reasonable square pixels
can be expected—and if they aren't square, it should be tackled on a different
layer, e.g. OS or device driver.

The calibration widget was inspired by [my own experiment](../techniques/absolute_units_evaluation.html)
and an [#614 issue comment](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614#issuecomment-611217635)
(now also [CSS-WG FAQ](https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#real-physical-lengths))
where @tabatkins describes a calibration page workaround:

> Notably, this would basically be:
>
> 1. Have a calibration page, where you ask the user to measure
>    the distance between two lines that are some CSS distance apart
>    (say, `10cm`), and input the value they get.
> 2. Use this to find the scaling factor necessary for that screen
>    (CSS length divided by user-provided length), and store it locally
>    (via localStorage, or a cookie, etc).
> 3. On the pages where you need the accurate length, fetch it from
>    local storage, and set a `--unit-scale: 1.07;` (subbing
>    in the real value) property on the `html` element.
> 4. Anywhere you use a length that needs to be accurate, instead of
>    `width: 5cm;`, write `width: calc(5cm * var(--unit-scale, 1));`.
>
> This is a robust and minimal calibration scheme that will
> "fail open" - if the user hasn't calibrated, or clears local data, or
> has JS turned off, it'll just use standard CSS units (due to the , 1
> default arg for the unit scale), rather than breaking.


## About this Document

This article is answering a "work order" in the form of a
[comment by @frivoal on w3c/csswg-drafts#614](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614)
, a discussion on the Topic **"[css-values] Ability to address actual physical size #614"**:

In the meantime, there's also an entry in the [CSS-WG FAQ](https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#real-physical-lengths),
describing  the history and status of the topic and a new
[issue #5986 \[css-env\] Device Pixel Ratio](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5986)
trying to move the discussion forward.

### Disclosure

As of beginning this, I don't know if a good case can be built, but
I'm instinctively biased towards having the ability to use real-world
physical sizes in CSS. I found out about the bigger discussion right after
collecting my observations in [Real World Absolute Length Units Evaluation](../techniques/absolute_units_evaluation.html).

### Contribute

## Debate

### Critique of the CSS-Reference-Pixel

Examples, where the CSS-Reference-Pixel model solves issues, that seem to
be harder to tackle in the physical-measurements model, are often used as
counterpoints to having access to physical measurements in CSS at all. This
kind of argumentation should be considered bad style, rather than disputing
that, I'm going to explain where I see the shortcomings of the
CSS-Reference-Pixel. I hope this will show why **a complementary model**
with some sort of access to physical measurements is necessary. I do believe
the CSS-Reference-Pixel is in general a very good idea.

The way the CSS-Reference-Pixel *"just works"* is, irrespective of its fancy
definition via the visual angle and viewing distance, a simple *"just
scale everything”* so that it looks to be the same size, regardless of
the viewing distance.

While this has proven to work in many cases, it breaks down when it comes
to situations where **precision and fidelity are required**, either by
the nature of the viewing situation or by the diligence of the author
who wants to create the best possible design.

### Excursion: The Tale of Fixed Media

Despite all the reasons, why physical measurements are said to fail or not,
we do already [have](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#absolute-lengths)
the concept of *"anchoring"* especially for *"print media"* to physical
measurements:

> For a CSS device, these dimensions are anchored either
>
> 1. by relating the physical units to their physical measurements, or
> 2. by relating the pixel unit to the reference pixel.
>
> For print media at typical viewing distances, the anchor unit should be
> one of the standard physical units (inches, centimeters, etc). For screen
> media (including high-resolution devices), low-resolution devices, and
> devices with unusual viewing distances, it is recommended instead that
> the anchor unit be the pixel unit. For such devices it is recommended
> that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels that
> best approximates the reference pixel.

#### Typical Viewing Distance

… is tricky: it's not explicitly set anywhere in the device, nor does the
spec document it or explain how to determine it. Instead, it is left to
device manufacturers, operating systems, and user preferences to somehow
come to a scaling factor that pleases or is good enough; *there's no
precision*. Usually backward from there, *if we know some real-world
measurement of the screen like PPI, its measurements, or the `--unit-scale-physical`
factor*, we can [calculate](#calculate-device-typical-viewing-distance)
what the typical viewing distance is i.e. **the viewing distance at which
the device matches the CSS-Reference-Pixel**. In the context of this article,
this is how the term is used. *Note:* calculation from PPI or screen measurements
would require additional information, like `window.devicePixelRatio` or
`window.screen.width`.

#### The Golden Hammer

The big question is: **If the CSS-Reference-Pixel is the golden hammer
that fixes all of our problems, why would anyone ever want to anchor to
physical measurements, even in print?**

Although I've seen claims that printers do not produce accurate output,
in my tests with my home printer the measurements are *highly accurate*.
The scale option in the print dialog is however an easy-to-trigger source
of error: always set it to 100 %, and don't allow "fit to page width" or
similar options. (If that doesn't fix it, the calibration scheme as described here
works for print as well!)

The claim I made, that the CSS-Reference-Pixel is a simple
scheme of *"just scale everything”* can be illustrated well using
the print dialog. Consider the ISO 216 (DIN 476) A-paper-format, in this
example, we designed a flyer for an A6 postcard format. The design is set
in absolute units and the printer (A) anchors to physical measurements.
We know that at `28 inches` distance, "nominal arm’s length", our flyer design
matches the CSS-Reference-Pixel. A1 is `~ 5.65` (= <code>(√2)<sup>5</sup></code>)
times larger than A6, which puts its typical viewing distance to match
the CSS-Reference-Pixel at `158.2 inches` (`5.65 × 28`, `~ 4.02 meter`).
If we send our flyer to a printer (B) to print at A1, the printer, in
this case anchors to the CSS-Reference-Pixel and has determined, that the
typical viewing distance of an A1 Poster is `158.2 inches`, we get a
perfectly scaled version of our flyer. However, printers do not
anchor to the CSS-Reference-Pixel. Hence, to get the same result, in our
print dialog we must choose the option "*Scale: Fit to page width*" in other
words *"just scale everything”*.

*Note:* if the typical viewing distance would be a different value in B,
the design would not fit the page exactly and end up either larger or smaller
than the page size, in such a case media-queries could rescue us, but that
applies regardless of the unit anchoring.

With the example in mind, we can also rephrase the *big question* and ask:
**If it is that simple, why don't designers make one layout for print and
then *"just scale everything”?***

The answer is simple: design for print doesn't work that way. In fact it
is discredited to take a flyer and just print it as a poster or vice versa.
One would analyze the anticipated viewing conditions and then find a layout
that matches these conditions best. Classically, a poster doesn't
have a single typical viewing distance. Instead, since the size and location
of the poster are fixed and interaction is limited (no zoom, no scroll), viewing
distance becomes an *instrument of design* and *it is not fixed*. One could
say, viewing distance is the primary interaction model of a poster, and it
could work something like this:

 * **viewer is farther** (~ 20 – 10 meters) The poster must capture attention.
 * **viewer is far** (~ 8 – 5 meters) Most important information is revealed (who, what).
 * **viewer is close** (under ~ 3 meters) All required information e.g. to visit the event (when, where, how).
 * **viewer is closer** (under ~ 1 meter) Legal information, contact data etc.

On a smaller flyer, the spread of font sizes from "farther" to "closer"
will be less than on a larger poster, the "closer" fonts must get larger,
and the font-size differences between steps must get smaller. The Poster
has more real estate to create visual tension. Put in other words: when
viewed next to each other, scaled to the same size, most apparently, the
large poster design has smaller fonts for the "closer" range, they would
become unreadable small when scaled down to flyer size. But also the
differences between font-sizes in the hierarchy overall will be lesser
in the design for the smaller flyer. It's not a linear scaling at all.

#### Fixed Media

… defined for the purpose of this article, is a superset
of print media; it also includes other media, when they have similar properties
to print. Fixed media is not primarily interactive, meaning that it can't
be zoomed, scrolled, or clicked by the viewer; it may be paged or animated
though, it may even have interactive aspects, but those are secondary. An
example is digital signage or digital advertisements in public space, etc.
The medium is "fixed" because it does not appear on the device of the viewer,
rather, the viewer appears and the media is already there, as in fixed
to a wall.

Suppose we have a poster-like fixed media advertisement, targeted at
poster-like digital signage screens. The screen sizes may still differ across the
deployment. Of course, we design it using the CSS-Reference-Pixel model,
*because that's the golden hammer*, everything gets scaled to fit the
screens according to their typical viewing distance. Of course, we want to
stick to our viewing distance based interaction model, *because that's best
practice*, after all, in relative terms "farther", "far", "close", "closer"
can still be expressed in CSS-sizes, just like `xx-large`, `large`, `small`
and `xx-small` can be expressed relative to the default `medium`  `font-size`.


In the fixed media example two differently sized screens are:

|                 | aspect ratio | device pixels   | PPI    | physical measurements                  | the width of … |
|---------------- | :----------: | --------------- | ------:| :------------------------------------- |:--------------:|
|**small screen** | 9:16         | 2160:3840 (UHD) | 184.62 | 11.7:20.8&nbsp;in (29.7:52.8&nbsp;cm)  | A3             |
|**large screen** | 9:16         | 2160:3840 (UHD) |  65.26 | 33.1:58.8&nbsp;in (84.1:149.5&nbsp;cm) | A0             |

We could set them up so that they are calibrated to physical units, this
would require setting the `device-pixel-ratio [browser zoom]` (**d-p-r**) for the
small screen to `1.92 [192%]` (`~1125:2000 CSS-px`) and for the large screen
to `0.68 [68%]` (`~3176:5647 CSS-px`). Now both screens would
have a default viewing distance of 28 inches and a print-media to screen-media
transformation would work seamlessly. But this would be an extreme
setup, it is also exactly like the calibration this article is trying to
establish.

More typical would be if the small screen had a d-p-r
of maybe `2 [200%]` (`1080:1920 CSS-px`), putting its typical viewing
distance at `29.11 inches` (`73.96 centimeters`), and the large screen had a
d-p-r of maybe `3 [300%]` (`720:1280 CSS-px`), putting
its typical viewing distance at `123.57 inches` (`313.86 centimeters`).

If the larger screen was set to `2 [200%]` as well, we would have no way
in CSS to distinguish it from the small screen, from the perspective of a
media query it would look in every aspect the same. Thus the resulting
image would have to be the same as on the small screen, just scaled.
Fortunately, we set it differently, that screen in media queries would
appear to be smaller in CSS-units and also have to receive the styles of
the larger design. **This heuristic is not only counterintuitive, it is
also arbitrary**. If we design like this, we are going to have the same
result for the A0-sized screen also when viewing on a mobile phone, because
to us they appear to be the same.

#### The Lesson Learned

At this moment we can end this excursion. From looking at screen sizes
that are normalized with the CSS-Reference-Pixel model, we can't possibly
make conclusions about the physical sizes—which is, by the way, the whole
point of the model—and **therefore we can't optimize our design for
fixed media**. Permissible results must be oriented at whatever works at a
distance of an arm’s length. This is actively harmful for general design
quality. Like clipping in signals, it's limiting the
range of expression and the precision that good design offers, in German,
we have a word for what is left: **"Einheitsbrei"** (~ uniformity-mush).

### Absolute Physical Measurements Would Mess with Zooming.

Where zooming is possible we must not take it away, it simply has higher
priority. If there's an important reason why something must be displayed
true to scale, the page or app should inform the user and if possible
detect zooming and warn. Moreover, Page-Zoom already invokes media-queries,
these will keep working, and added support for the new model will improve
the situation further. Ways to handle the fact of zooming will evolve,
it's not a blocker.

There are however also [situations where zooming is not possible](#excursion-the-tale-of-fixed-media),
the UA may not be controllable by the viewer, in those cases, informed
design with physical measurements will likely help to improve the situation,
rather than having the CSS-Reference-Pixel impose a not ideal solution.

### Browsers are bad at reliably and accurately knowing the actual size and resolution of your display.

*Paraphrased from the [CSS-WG FAQ](https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#real-physical-lengths).*

That's why [the proposal](#browser-support-roadmap) is to have **a progressively
enhancing model**. Some devices can be very reliable, like phones and tablets,
where the display is integrated, these devices could just work. In other
cases, the best solution is to ask the user for calibration via a widget,
similar to the one that is demonstrated here. The calibration could happen
on the page directly, but it would be ideal if the user agent or the OS
could provide this service. In my opinion, the user agent would be the sweet
spot to implement this. The page or app could provide its own widget as
a polyfill until it has stabilized.

If the hardware/system reports display sizes, it would, in any case, be necessary
that the user can control and, where required, override that information
with own measurements, using a calibration widget.

### Authors would misuse accurate real-world units and give users a bad experience.

*Paraphrased from the [CSS-WG FAQ](https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#real-physical-lengths).*

We should not protect authors from their inability, instead, teach them
how to use these tools to achieve the best for their users. Also that the
CSS-Reference-Pixel should be their default choice.

The argument could also be turned around, identifying cases where the
automatism provided by the CSS-Reference-Pixel gives users a bad or
worse than ideal experience, and since CSS has no escape mechanism yet,
this could be identified as a form of violence.

It's OK that working with real physical measurements would make some
things harder, the gist is that it would enable other things that are
impossible to achieve under the CSS-Reference-Pixel. This is OK because the models
are **complementary**, there's no need to pick a side.

### We would break interoperability/the internet.

If we can't break anything, it will also be hard to do any good. We should
assume that authors act in good faith, that they want to create working
designs, that they work hard to achieve that, and that they will find elegant
solutions to difficult problems.

Let's instead focus on *the tools that we already have in CSS* to make
robust designs and that will stay available. Because, without these tools,
even the CSS-Reference-Pixel would fail to deliver on its promise.

There are:

 * Relative length units, like `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw` etc.
 * Percentages `%`
 * CSS functions, like `min()`, `max()`, `calc()`, `clamp()` and `var()`
 * overflow controls
 * Media Queries, although, these would have to beef up a bit.

And not to forget, the CSS-Reference-Pixel model will also stay
available at all times, either to complement or — especially with media
query support — we could create e.g. hybrid pages that leverage the best
of both models.

## Use Cases

**[Add more Use Cases!](https://github.com/graphicore/varla-varfo/discussions/9)**

### Calculate Device Typical Viewing Distance

The [typical viewing distance](#typical-viewing-distance) for which a screen
is set up, to match the CSS-Reference-Pixel, is usually opaque to the user
as well as to the CSS-author. One result of that is, that it is hard to assess
whether a device displays contents too big or too small or **how far away
from a device one should be to enjoy that standard.**

From the [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#absolute-lengths):

> The reference pixel is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with
> a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm’s
> length. For a nominal arm’s length of 28 inches [71,12 centimeters],
> the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees. For reading at
> arm’s length, 1px thus corresponds to about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch).

With calibration as established above, it's simple to calculate the
implied viewing distance for this screen:

`let unitScalePhysical = `<code class="insert insert-unit-scale-physical"></code>`;`

JavaScript, calculating `normalReadingDistance` in inches:

```js
/* It's sufficient to just scale the nominal arm's length: */

let normalReadingDistance = 28 / unitScalePhysical;

/* Alternatively the same result can be calculated using the visual angle,
 * but this can be simplified to the above.
 */

let alpha = Math.atan2(1/96/2, 28),
    normalReadingDistance = 1/96/2/unitScalePhysical/Math.tan(alpha);
```

On your device, the reading distance to have one CSS-pixel to appear at a
visual angle of 0.0213 degrees is:

<strong class="insert insert-normal-reading-distance"></strong>

In other words at that distance, one inch would appear as big as one physical
inch appears when viewed from a distance of 28 inches.

  <strong> = <span class="insert insert-real-window-width-cm"></span> by <span class="insert insert-real-window-height-cm"></span> centimeters</strong>
* real device width and height `window.screen.width / 96 / unitScalePhysical`<br />
  *<a name="window-screen-caveat">CAVEAT</a>:* The `window.screen` browser APIs needs  fixing:
    * [There's a bug with Firefox on Wayland](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661540)
      I get odd values from `window.screen`, it reports `width` and `height` in
      device pixels, while the combination with Gnome on Xorg is fine and reporting
      values in CSS-Pixels.
    * [Chromium/Chrome does not make the necessary adaptions to `window.screen`
      when using browser zoom.](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=923686)
      Media-queries with e.g. `max-width` seem to get it right.
    * Looks like it's better to use `window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight`,
      could also generally be more robust for usability.

### Accurate Design

* The section about [fixed media](#excursion-the-tale-of-fixed-media)
  describes this extensively.
* Knowing the real screen size will make it possible for designers to
  make better-informed decisions: design quality will improve.

### True to Scale Detail Reproduction, Research, Scientific Surveys

 * For research e.g. of archive material or digital collaboration, sometimes
   having an impression of a thing's true size is really important.
 * Show the actual scale ratio of an image displayed on the screen.
 * Readability, usability, a-b-testing studies, especially when online, create comparable conditions.

### E-Commerce

 * People always want to know the physical size of the book, phone, watch, postcard,
   shoe, pen… whatever they are ordering. What better way than to just show it in the online shop?
 * Make size matching simple. E.g. for online shopping, decide the correct
   size of gloves by matching the user's hand and a 1:1 image of the glove
   directly on the screen.

### Design Proofing

 * Proofing type design when drawing, e.g. for optical sizes designers use
   printed on paper samples to assess design quality precisely at the right
   font size. **We can help to save trees when we help designers to print
   less!** Proofing optical size font designs on screens will be very
   much welcome.
 * Assessment of type design, e.g. when choosing type it's good to see it
   in its intended size.
 * Pre-print proofing design, typographic design, layouts, etc. get an accurate
   impression of how big a design will be. This is necessary to judge layout
   and typographic choices such as font sizes, margins, line heights, etc.
 * Get an accurate impression of how big a design will appear from different
   distances. E.g. *"If you are 28 inches away from the screen the poster will
   appear as if the original was 15 meters away."* Sounds a lot like the
   CSS-Reference-Pixel, but in this case, it would be accurate and not
   approximated by a black box.
 * Photo development apps, for instance, you could match the sizing of 4 in x 6 in
   prints, or 35 mm film negatives.

### Web Design Proofing

 * Effective web proofing. Give designers a correctly scaled preview
   impression of a website on actual phone-model screen size. In other
   words, proof the CSS-Reference-Pixel so that you know accurately how
   big things will appear.
 * Touch device UI must be touched with physical fingers, hence controls
   designed with physical sizes are best practice. But, we can also just
   proof for those devices using calibrated CSS:
   *"Will a 1 by 1 CSS-centimeter touch target be big enough?"*

### Measuring, Workplace Integration, Research and Development

 * An engineer's workplace that combines analogue and digital tools into a
   seamless experience.
 * A geographer's or architect's workplace where paper maps and plans from the
   archive or plotter and digital GIS/digital mapping and CAD-data are scaled
   accurately and can be easily compared directly.
 * Drawing / tracing apps for the iPad or other tablets, artists need to
   control the physical sizing of drawings and could have correct size data
   directly attached to their images.
 * A roller coaster entry sign: **"You must be at least this tall to ride."** 1.30m,
   with  a measurement bar. It would also be a good case to display a warning
   when the screen is too small to display the full sign at the right size.
 * Laboratory templates, [example in #614 ff.](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614#issuecomment-606438728) by @spawnia:
   *"The exact placement is paramount, so we show a template that indicates
   the points where the reagent has to be pipetted upon. In order for that
   to work, we need to have the template on the screen match the physical
   slide 1:1."*
 * Kitchen staff or barkeeper instructions.

### Implementing Effective Standards for Readability

* Font sizes for legal print, there could be definitions for absolute
  requirements, often by law, and sometimes by *corporate compliance policy*.
  E.g. Fonts may regularly become smaller than 12 pt because the device
  is set up to be viewed from closer than 28 Inches, like a typical phone
  or tablet.
* Optimize readability, see the [subtitle example
  in #614 ff.](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614#issuecomment-542110115) by @nigelmegitt:
  *"If we could set physical sizes, we would have less need to compromise the user experience."*

### Kids and Education

 * Ruler web-app for smartphones and tablets. Kids would use this and sometimes
   it would be just handy for anyone.
 * Practical experiments, e.g. Astronomy, the size of the sun, how big we
   perceive it from the earth. I made an example here:
   <figure class="celestial_bodies">
      <!--
      Numbers from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter#Use_in_astronomy
                                  only arcsec     radians
      Sun        31′27″ – 32′32″   1887″ - 1952″
      Moon       29′20″ – 34′6″    1760″ - 2046″
      Venus      9.7″ – 1′6″       9.7″ - 66″
      Jupiter                      29.8″ – 50.1″
      Saturn                       14.5″ – 20.1″
      Mars                         3.5″ – 25.1″
      Mercury                      4.5″ – 13.0″
      Uranus                       3.3″ – 4.1″
      Neptune                      2.2″ – 2.4″

      Using 2050″ as a base for the svg-unit size of this svg
      that way, all circles can be defined directly in their arcseconds
      size and stay true in relation to each other and it is good to
      calculate.

      1radian = 3,600 × 180 / PI arcseconds

      angleArcSec = 2050″
      angleRadians = angleArcSec / (3600 * 180 / Math.PI))
      angleRadians = 0.5694444444444444;

      width = 5cm
      distance = width / Math.tan(angleRadians)
      distance = 503.0807521619239 cm

      distance = 100cm
      width = distance * Math.tan(angleRadians)
      width = 0.9938762273279493 cm

 * It's nice when they can use actual rulers to do e.g. math or physics
   things on the screen.

### Out of the Box

 * Board/tabletop games that integrate e.g. a tablet app could get creative
   here, sometimes showing physical game elements (board, pieces) at actual
   size, or showing screen contents that relate to the physical sizes of
   those game elements.
 * Post-It note templates – imagine a wall of monitors with columns for
   Post-It notes. This could very much be a thing at companies like IBM
   who do "Design Thinking" corporate workshops, along with hundreds of
   Post-It notes.


## Browser Support Roadmap

Conceiving a roadmap of how progressive browser support could be established
in four milestones.

### Level 0

Now. The workaround [calibration widget](#css-calibration-widget) exists
and it is proven to work. Authors can start to use physical measurements,
experiment, find solutions and usage patterns, and lead by example.
We can get the word out, search for allies and create momentum.

**If you implemented the calibration scheme:
[Please send the link!](https://github.com/graphicore/varla-varfo/discussions/9) it will be [added](#implementations).**

We can **improve the user experience around the calibration process** of a
website or app that uses physical measurements. The user should be notified
that a page uses calibration, ask the user to check from time to time if
calibration values are correct. Maybe we can try to make educated guesses
when calibration is invalid e.g. a `window.screen` and `window.devicePixelRatio`
fingerprint could be saved along with the calibration value. Detect zoom
and find ways to handle it gracefully  etc. This effort would aim to make
the user experience good and solid but also to **show a way how UAs could
implement calibration directly.**

[Contribute to the calibration widget UX!](#contribute)

The way browsers handle user permissions e.g. "Send Notifications" or
"Open Pop-up Windows" has potential. If permissions are set there's an
icon in the address bar that toggles a "Site information" widget that can
be used to make settings. The same thing is also used to inform about the
connection security status. Maybe, in the future, a native UA calibration
tool could piggyback on that if a page uses calibration features.

![Browser permissions handling in address bar](./assets/browser-permissions-handling.png)

### Level 1

A CSS `env(unit-scale-physical)` property is the main goal. At the same
time, this is the hardest one to convince the CSS Working Group of; some
minds are already made up because similar attempts were made in the past
and because it would involve some effort on the browser vendor site.

One big contra argument always was that the calibration information would
involve getting reliable information from the hardware, and that this can’t
be done 100 % reliably all the time. As described in [Level 0](#level-0),
we can lead the way and show how to do this with user calibration as a fallback.
On the positive side, *it's not 100 % of devices either that **can't** report
reliable information.* There are even projectors that can auto-focus nowadays.

UA/Browser support for `env(unit-scale-physical)` would improve the user
experience a lot, and make the usage of physical measurements feasible
for many more pages. **Much less** calibration would have to be performed,
it would work across pages, and also UAs could maybe also decide better if
a calibration must be invalidated and renewed, e.g. when the screen has
changed.

The calibration widget could act as a polyfill until UAs catch up.

### Level 2

**Media-query support** would be incredibly useful. I’m not proposing how
exactly these media-queries will have to look. With the experience coming
from Level 0 and Level 1, we'll be able to describe precisely what kind
of media-queries are required. This would enable authors to improve
cross-device interoperability a lot.

### Level 3

A new CSS property `unit-anchoring: physical|pixel|author`, would be a logical consequence.

Technically it is already possible to anchor a document to physical
measurements instead of the CSS-Reference-Pixel, but it is a bit
complicated:

```css
/* Applied on :root this will anchor the entire website to
 * physical units.
 */
.physical-unit-anchoring {
    /* Scale everything. */
    `transform: scale(env(unit-scale-physical))`;
    /* The visual default font-size of the user can be preserved. */
    font-size: calc(100% / env(unit-scale-physical));
    /* Reset page width to pre-transform size. */
    width: calc(100% / env(unit-scale-physical));
}
```

*Note:* on `:root` this works better than on any generic element,
especially because the `transform` size changes of the element are not
compensated well in this example, i.e. element height or margin in block
direction would need adaptions to fit the transformed element into the
document flow, but these adaptions differ on a case by case basis.

According to the CSS spec, a UA can already decide to anchor to physical
measurements. This would add a way, from within CSS, to ask the UA to do a
specific anchoring. Together with Level 2 media query support, it would be
entirely possible to use this safely without having to compromise
on interoperability or futureproofness.
