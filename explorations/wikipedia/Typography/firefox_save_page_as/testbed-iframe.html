	Some rough ideas:

	slider-> portal width
	communicate: -> after changing portal width, ask for portal height and
				adjust... (could become interesting when we start to
				make media-queries based on height! but then, we just
				need to set it, not ask what it is ...)
		height => auto/fit

	zoom-option: 100% 1 iframe csspx = 1 csspx
				 fit to width: [width (slider?)] uses a transform

				devices, maybe actually a device-emulation using calibrated
						CSS and actual device sizes! This will set height!

	portal width  [text unit(px, ...) or drag/marquee] [option ]
	height [text unit(px, ...) or drag/marquee] [option auto-fit (communicate)]

	container-width:
			portal-width: no overflow
			[text unit(px, ...) or drag/marquee]: overflow: scroll
	portal-zoom: fit-to-container, 1:1, scale-to-physical


	Device width and height in CSS-Pixel is the main entry.
	Cannot set different device-pixel-ratios this way, yet, at all, because it
	won't change when css-transformed; but we don't need to use d-p-r
	@media queries.

	[x] use calibrated units // DB did not ask for this, but this is another use case!



	to width and heights:
			container
			portal

	ideally, the container never scrolls itself, but it can be used to
	remove the document flow issues that css `transform: scale()` has.

	transform can be used to make the portal fit to the container:
		* Either, put a known device css-pixel width and height to the portal
		and scale to a calibrated, known physical device size to make a
		good size-proof!

		* put some random/user choice width on the container and make the
		portal fit into the container, while it's width and height changes.
		Will look very much like browser zoom, like emulating changes to
		device-pixel-ratio (but the portal can't use this in media-queries).

		* None: the container has to fit to the portal size.
